# Quiet Tab

A small Manifest V3 extension for Chromium-based browsers that turns the new
tab page into a quiet, full-window desktop of your favorite links and local
weather tiles — nothing else.

## Features

- A full-window, macOS-style desktop grid: links, weather tiles and two fixed
  tiles (Settings and Add) sit on a 2D grid of 1×1, 2×1 or 2×2 cells. The
  number of columns follows the window (an even count, 2 or more); the tiles
  start in the middle of the window, a new tile goes to the free cell nearest the
  middle, a narrower window repacks the tiles for display only, and widening it
  restores your arrangement around the middle.
- Edit mode (turned on by the Settings tile; Settings again, Escape or a click
  on the background turns it off): tiles jiggle, a − badge deletes a link or
  hides a weather tile, and any tile can be dragged to a free cell.
- Add, edit and delete links (address, name, icon, color) through small dialogs;
  new links start at 1×1 and can be resized when editing. In edit mode the Add
  tile also restores hidden weather tiles.
- Opens saved favorites in the current tab.
- Uses site favicons with letter and custom-image fallbacks.
- Shows current weather for a city you choose as tiles in the same grid:
  temperature, UV index (with a WHO-scale level label), today's rain
  probability, and air quality. Each weather tile can be resized, hidden, and
  moved together with your links.
- Performs no background polling and has no analytics.

## Install

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome or another Chromium-based browser.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked**.
5. Select the repository directory.
6. Open a new tab.

The first launch shows the default tiles (weather, Settings, Add) and asks you
to set a city for the weather tiles in a small dialog (you can close it and set
a city later with the "Set a city" tile or from a weather tile's edit dialog).

## Permissions And Privacy

The manifest requests only:

- `storage` to persist favorites and your chosen weather city via Chrome
  Sync, and a short-lived weather cache and one prompt flag locally;
- `favicon` to display site favicons on link tiles;
- host access to Open-Meteo's forecast, air-quality, and geocoding
  endpoints to fetch weather for the city you choose.

Favorites and the chosen weather city are stored in `chrome.storage.sync`,
so they follow you to any other Chromium browser signed into the same Google
account with sync enabled and running this same extension — that's Chrome's
own built-in sync, not a project-run service. Favorites are not Chrome
bookmarks. A short-lived weather cache and a flag noting that you closed the
first-run city prompt are stored in `chrome.storage.local`, on this browser
profile only.

There is no remote content feed of any kind — no news, no analytics, no
telemetry. See [Privacy](docs/privacy.md) for details.
