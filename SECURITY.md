# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The latest released version receives security fixes. This is a small, single-purpose
browser extension; older versions are not maintained.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately rather than opening a public issue.
Use GitHub's **Report a vulnerability** (Security Advisories) on the repository,
or contact the maintainer directly through their GitHub profile.

Include enough detail to reproduce the issue. You can expect an initial response
within a reasonable time, and coordinated disclosure once a fix is available.

## Scope

Relevant areas for this extension:

- Cross-site scripting via rendered favorite labels or custom icon URLs.
- Leakage or corruption of locally persisted favorites or weather state.

The extension has no backend, no content scripts, no remote code, and no
broad host permissions; it only reads Open-Meteo's public, keyless weather,
air-quality, and geocoding endpoints, and Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) for
reverse geocoding when the user activates **use your location**. Its one
`declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess` rule only sets the `User-Agent` header on
requests to Nominatim.
